<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_1" data-id="RM11_1">I say then, did God reject his people? May it never be. For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_2" data-id="RM11_2">God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel?</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_3" data-id="RM11_3">"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars. I alone am left, and they are seeking my life."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_4" data-id="RM11_4">But what does God's answer say to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bent the knee to Baal."</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_5" data-id="RM11_5">Even so then, at this present time also there is a remnant because of the choice of grace.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_6" data-id="RM11_6">But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works. Otherwise grace would no longer be grace. <span class="note" id="footnote-284"><a href="#note-284" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_7" data-id="RM11_7">What then? The thing that Israel was seeking, it did not obtain, but the chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_8" data-id="RM11_8">It is just as it is written: "God has given them a spirit of dullness, eyes so that they should not see, and ears so that they should not hear, to this very day."</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_9" data-id="RM11_9">Then David says,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_9" data-id="RM11_9">"Let their table become a net and a trap,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_9" data-id="RM11_9">a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_10" data-id="RM11_10">Let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see,</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_10" data-id="RM11_10">and bend their backs continually."</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_11" data-id="RM11_11">I say then, "Did they stumble so as to fall?" May it never be. Instead, by their failure, salvation has come to the Gentiles, in order to provoke them to jealousy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_12" data-id="RM11_12">Now if their failure is the riches of the world, and if their loss is the riches of the Gentiles, how much greater will their completion be?</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_13" data-id="RM11_13">But now I am speaking to you Gentiles, and as long as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_14" data-id="RM11_14">Perhaps I will provoke to jealousy those who are of my own flesh. Perhaps we will save some of them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_15" data-id="RM11_15">For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_16" data-id="RM11_16">If the firstfruits are reserved, so is the lump of dough. If the root is reserved, so are the branches.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_17" data-id="RM11_17">But if some of the branches were broken off, if you, a wild olive branch, were grafted in among them, and if you shared with them in the rich root of the olive tree,</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_18" data-id="RM11_18">do not boast over the branches. But if you do boast, it is not you who supports the root, but the root that supports you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_19" data-id="RM11_19">You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_20" data-id="RM11_20">That is true. Because of their unbelief they were broken off, but you stand firm because of your faith. Do not think too highly of yourself, but fear.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_21" data-id="RM11_21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_22" data-id="RM11_22">Look at, then, the kind actions and the severity of God: severity came on the Jews who fell, but God's kindness comes on you, if you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_23" data-id="RM11_23">And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in. For God is able to graft them in again.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_24" data-id="RM11_24">For if you were cut out of what is by nature a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a good olive tree, how much more will these Jews, who are the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree?</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_25" data-id="RM11_25">For I do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, of this mystery, in order that you will not be wise in your own thinking. This mystery is that a partial hardening has occurred in Israel, until the completion of the Gentiles come in.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_26" data-id="RM11_26">Thus all Israel will be saved, just as it is written:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_26" data-id="RM11_26">"Out of Zion will come the Deliverer.</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_26" data-id="RM11_26">He will remove ungodliness from Jacob,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_27" data-id="RM11_27">and this will be my covenant with them,</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_27" data-id="RM11_27">when I will take away their sins."</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_28" data-id="RM11_28">As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake. But as far as election is concerned, they are beloved because of their forefathers.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_29" data-id="RM11_29">For the gifts and the call of God are unchangeable.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_30" data-id="RM11_30">For you were formerly disobedient to God, but now you have received mercy because of their disobedience.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_31" data-id="RM11_31">In the same way, now these Jews have been disobedient. The result was that by the mercy shown to you they may also now receive mercy.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_32" data-id="RM11_32">For God has shut up all into disobedience, in order that he might show mercy on all.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_33" data-id="RM11_33">Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways beyond discovering!</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_34" data-id="RM11_34">"For who has known the mind of the Lord</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_34" data-id="RM11_34">or who has become his advisor?</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_35" data-id="RM11_35">Or who has first given anything to God,</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v RM11_35" data-id="RM11_35">that God must repay him?"</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM11_36" data-id="RM11_36">For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever. Amen.</span>
