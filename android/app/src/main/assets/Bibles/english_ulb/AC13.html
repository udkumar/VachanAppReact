<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_1" data-id="AC13_1">Now in the church in Antioch, there were some prophets and teachers. They were Barnabas, Simeon (who is called Niger), Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch), and Saul.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_2" data-id="AC13_2">While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul, to do the work to which I have called them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_3" data-id="AC13_3">After they had fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on these men, they sent them off.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_4" data-id="AC13_4">So Barnabas and Saul obeyed the Holy Spirit and went down to Seleucia; from there they sailed to the island of Cyprus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_5" data-id="AC13_5">When they were in the city of Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John Mark as their assistant.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_6" data-id="AC13_6">When they had gone through the whole island to Paphos, they found a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, whose name was Bar Jesus.</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_7" data-id="AC13_7">This magician associated with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, because he wanted to hear the word of God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_8" data-id="AC13_8">But Elymas "the magician" (that is how his name is translated) opposed them; he tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_9" data-id="AC13_9">But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, stared at him intensely.</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_10" data-id="AC13_10">and said, "You son of the devil, you are full of all kinds of deceit and wickedness. You are an enemy of every kind of righteousness. You will never stop twisting the straight paths of the Lord, will you?</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_11" data-id="AC13_11">Now look, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will become blind. You will not see the sun for a while." Immediately there fell on Elymas a mist and darkness; he started going around asking people to lead him by the hand.</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_12" data-id="AC13_12">After the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, because he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_13" data-id="AC13_13">Now Paul and his friends set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and returned to Jerusalem.</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_14" data-id="AC13_14">Paul and his friends traveled from Perga and came to Antioch of Pisidia. There they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_15" data-id="AC13_15">After the reading of the law and the prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent them a message saying, "Brothers, if you have any message of encouragement for the people here, say it."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_16" data-id="AC13_16">So Paul stood up and motioned with his hand; he said, "Men of Israel and you who honor God, listen.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_17" data-id="AC13_17">The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people numerous when they stayed in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he led them out of it.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_18" data-id="AC13_18">For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. <span class="note" id="footnote-275"><a href="#note-275" class="key">†</a></span></span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_19" data-id="AC13_19">After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave our people their land for an inheritance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_20" data-id="AC13_20">All these events took place over four hundred and fifty years. After all these things, God gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_21" data-id="AC13_21">Then the people asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, to be king for forty years.</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_22" data-id="AC13_22">After God removed him from the kingship, he raised up David to be their king. It was about David that God said, 'I have found David son of Jesse to be a man after my heart, who does all I want him to do.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_23" data-id="AC13_23">From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel a savior, Jesus, as he promised to do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_24" data-id="AC13_24">This began to happen when, before Jesus came, John first announced the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_25" data-id="AC13_25">As John was finishing his work, he said, 'Who do you think I am? I am not the one. But listen, one is coming after me, the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_26" data-id="AC13_26">Brothers, children of the line of Abraham, and those among you who worship God, it is to us that the message about this salvation has been sent.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_27" data-id="AC13_27">For they who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers, did not recognize him, and they fulfilled sayings of the prophets that are read every Sabbath by condemning him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_28" data-id="AC13_28">Even though they found no good cause for death in him, they asked Pilate to kill him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_29" data-id="AC13_29">When they had completed all the things that were written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_30" data-id="AC13_30">But God raised him from the dead.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_31" data-id="AC13_31">He was seen for many days by those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. These people are now his witnesses to the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_32" data-id="AC13_32">So we are telling you the gospel that what God promised to our fathers</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_33" data-id="AC13_33">he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC13_33" data-id="AC13_33">'You are my Son, today I have become your Father.'</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_34" data-id="AC13_34">The fact that he raised him up from the dead so that his body would never decay, God has spoken in this way:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC13_34" data-id="AC13_34">'I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.'</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_35" data-id="AC13_35">This is why he also says in another Psalm,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC13_35" data-id="AC13_35">'You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.'</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_36" data-id="AC13_36">For when David had served the desires of God in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was laid with his fathers and his body experienced decay.</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_37" data-id="AC13_37">But he whom God raised up experienced no decay.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_38" data-id="AC13_38">So let it be known to you, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you forgiveness of sins.</span>
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_39" data-id="AC13_39">By him every one who believes is justified from all the things which the law of Moses could not justify you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_40" data-id="AC13_40">So then be careful that the thing the prophets spoke about does not happen to you:</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
</div>
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_41" data-id="AC13_41">'Look, you despisers, and be astonished and then perish;</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC13_41" data-id="AC13_41">For I am doing a work in your days,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC13_41" data-id="AC13_41">A work that you shall never believe, even if someone announces it to you.'"</div>
</span>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_42" data-id="AC13_42">As Paul and Barnabas left, the people begged them that they might speak these same words again the next Sabbath.</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_43" data-id="AC13_43">When the synagogue meeting ended, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_44" data-id="AC13_44">On the next Sabbath, almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of the Lord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_45" data-id="AC13_45">When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and spoke against the things that were said by Paul and insulted him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_46" data-id="AC13_46">But Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, "It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing you push it away from yourselves and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, see, we will turn to the Gentiles.</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_47" data-id="AC13_47">For so has the Lord commanded us, saying,</span>
</div>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC13_47" data-id="AC13_47">'I have placed you as a light for the Gentiles,</div>
</span>
<div class="q">
<span class="v AC13_47" data-id="AC13_47">that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"</div>
</span>
<div class="m">
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_48" data-id="AC13_48">As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and praised the word of the Lord. As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_49" data-id="AC13_49">The word of the Lord was spread out through the whole region.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_50" data-id="AC13_50">But the Jews urged on the devout and important women, as well as the leading men of the city. These stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them out beyond the border of their city.</span>
<span class="v-num v-51 " data-id="bibleJsn">51&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_51" data-id="AC13_51">But Paul and Barnabas shook off the dust from their feet against them. Then they went to the city of Iconium.</span>
<span class="v-num v-52 " data-id="bibleJsn">52&nbsp;</span><span class="v AC13_52" data-id="AC13_52">And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</span>
