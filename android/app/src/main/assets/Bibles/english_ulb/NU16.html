<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_1" data-id="NU16_1">Now Korah son of Izhar son of Kohath son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, descendants of Reuben, gathered some men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_2" data-id="NU16_2">They rose up against Moses, along with other men from the people of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the community who were well-known members in the community.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_3" data-id="NU16_3">They assembled themselves together to confront Moses and Aaron. They said to them, "You have gone too far! All the community is set apart, every one of them, and Yahweh is among them. Why do you lift up yourselves above the rest of Yahweh's community?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_4" data-id="NU16_4">When Moses heard that, he lay facedown.</span>
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_5" data-id="NU16_5">He spoke to Korah and to all those with him, "In the morning Yahweh will make known who belongs to him and who is set apart to him. He will bring that person near to him. The one he chooses he will bring near to himself.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_6" data-id="NU16_6">Do this, Korah and all your group. Take censers</span>
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_7" data-id="NU16_7">tomorrow and put fire and incense in them before Yahweh. The one whom Yahweh chooses, that man will be set apart to Yahweh. You have gone too far, you descendants of Levi."</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_8" data-id="NU16_8">Again, Moses said to Korah, "Now listen, you descendants of Levi:</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_9" data-id="NU16_9">is it a small thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do work in Yahweh's tabernacle, and to stand before the community to serve them?</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_10" data-id="NU16_10">He has brought you near, and all your kinfolk, the descendants of Levi, with you, yet you are seeking the priesthood also!</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_11" data-id="NU16_11">Therefore you and all your company have assembled against Yahweh. Who is Aaron that you grumble against him?"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_12" data-id="NU16_12">Then Moses called for Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, "We will not come up.</span>
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_13" data-id="NU16_13">Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness? Now you want to make yourself ruler over us!</span>
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_14" data-id="NU16_14">In addition, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, or given us the fields and vineyards as an inheritance. Now do you want to blind us with empty promises? We will not come to you."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_15" data-id="NU16_15">Moses was very angry and said to Yahweh, "Do not respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not harmed any of them."</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_16" data-id="NU16_16">Then Moses said to Korah, "Tomorrow you and all your company must go before Yahweh—you and they, and Aaron.</span>
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_17" data-id="NU16_17">Each of you must take his censer and put incense in it. Then each man must bring before Yahweh his censer, two hundred and fifty censers. You and Aaron, also, must each bring your censer."</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_18" data-id="NU16_18">So every man took his censer, put fire in it, laid incense in it, and stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_19" data-id="NU16_19">Korah assembled all the community against Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and Yahweh's glory appeared to all the community.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_20" data-id="NU16_20">Then Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron:</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_21" data-id="NU16_21">"Separate yourselves from among this community that I may consume them immediately."</span>
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_22" data-id="NU16_22">Moses and Aaron lay facedown and said, "God, the God of the spirits of all humanity, if one man sins, must you be angry with all the community?"</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_23" data-id="NU16_23">Yahweh replied to Moses. He said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_24" data-id="NU16_24">"Speak to the community. Say, 'Get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.'"</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_25" data-id="NU16_25">Then Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed him.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_26" data-id="NU16_26">He spoke to the community and said, "Now leave the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs, or you will be consumed by all their sins."</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_27" data-id="NU16_27">So the community on every side of the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram left them. Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance to their tents, with their wives, sons, and their little ones.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_28" data-id="NU16_28">Then Moses said, "By this you will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of my own accord.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_29" data-id="NU16_29">If these men die a natural death such as normally happens, then Yahweh has not sent me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_30" data-id="NU16_30">But if Yahweh creates something new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that they possess, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you must understand that these men have despised Yahweh."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_31" data-id="NU16_31">As soon as Moses finished speaking all these words, the ground opened under those men.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_32" data-id="NU16_32">The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their families, and all the people who belonged to Korah, as well as all their possessions.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_33" data-id="NU16_33">So they and all that they possessed went down alive into Sheol. The earth closed over them, and they perished from among the community.</span>
<span class="v-num v-34 " data-id="bibleJsn">34&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_34" data-id="NU16_34">All Israel around them fled from their cries. They exclaimed, "The earth may swallow us up also!"</span>
<span class="v-num v-35 " data-id="bibleJsn">35&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_35" data-id="NU16_35">Then fire flashed out from Yahweh and devoured the 250 men who had offered incense.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-36 " data-id="bibleJsn">36&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_36" data-id="NU16_36">Again Yahweh spoke to Moses and said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-37 " data-id="bibleJsn">37&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_37" data-id="NU16_37">"Speak to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest and let him take up the censers out of the flames, for the censers are set apart to me. Then let him scatter the burning coals at a distance.</span>
<span class="v-num v-38 " data-id="bibleJsn">38&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_38" data-id="NU16_38">Take the censers of those who lost their lives because of their sin. Let them be made into hammered plates as a covering over the altar. Those men did offer them before me, so they are set apart to me. They will be a sign of my presence to the people of Israel."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-39 " data-id="bibleJsn">39&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_39" data-id="NU16_39">Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that had been used by the men who were burned up, and they were hammered out into a covering for the altar,</span>
<span class="v-num v-40 " data-id="bibleJsn">40&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_40" data-id="NU16_40">to be a reminder to the people of Israel, so that no outsider who was not descended from Aaron should come up to burn incense before Yahweh, so they might not become like Korah and his group—just as Yahweh had commanded through Moses.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-41 " data-id="bibleJsn">41&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_41" data-id="NU16_41">But the next morning all the community of the people of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron. They said, "You have killed Yahweh's people."</span>
<span class="v-num v-42 " data-id="bibleJsn">42&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_42" data-id="NU16_42">Then it happened, when the community had assembled against Moses and Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting and, behold, the cloud was covering it. Yahweh's glory appeared,</span>
<span class="v-num v-43 " data-id="bibleJsn">43&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_43" data-id="NU16_43">and Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.</span>
<span class="v-num v-44 " data-id="bibleJsn">44&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_44" data-id="NU16_44">Then Yahweh spoke to Moses. He said,</span>
<span class="v-num v-45 " data-id="bibleJsn">45&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_45" data-id="NU16_45">"Go away from in front of this community so that I may consume them immediately." Then Moses and Aaron lay down with their faces to the ground.</span>
<span class="v-num v-46 " data-id="bibleJsn">46&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_46" data-id="NU16_46">Moses said to Aaron, "Take the censer, put fire in it from off the altar, put incense in it, carry it quickly to the community, and make atonement for them, because anger is coming from Yahweh. The plague has begun."</span>
<span class="v-num v-47 " data-id="bibleJsn">47&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_47" data-id="NU16_47">So Aaron did as Moses directed. He ran into the middle of the community. The plague had quickly started to spread among the people, so he put in the incense and made atonement for the people.</span>
<span class="v-num v-48 " data-id="bibleJsn">48&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_48" data-id="NU16_48">Aaron stood between the dead and the living; in this way the plague was stopped.</span>
<span class="v-num v-49 " data-id="bibleJsn">49&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_49" data-id="NU16_49">Those who died by the plague were 14,700 in number, besides those who had died in the matter of Korah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-50 " data-id="bibleJsn">50&nbsp;</span><span class="v NU16_50" data-id="NU16_50">Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and the plague ended.</span>
