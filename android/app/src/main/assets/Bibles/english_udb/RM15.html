<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-1 " data-id="bibleJsn">1&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_1" data-id="RM15_1">Those of us believers who are sure that God allows us to do many more things than other believers think he allows them to do—we should be patient with them and allow them to inconvenience us. This is more important than our pleasing ourselves.</span>
<span class="v-num v-2 " data-id="bibleJsn">2&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_2" data-id="RM15_2">Each of us should do the things that please our fellow believers, and things that will help them, things that will encourage them to trust in the Messiah.</span>
<span class="v-num v-3 " data-id="bibleJsn">3&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_3" data-id="RM15_3">We should please our fellow believers, since the Messiah has set us an example. He did not do things to please himself. On the contrary, he tried to please God even when others insulted him. That was as the scriptures say: "When people insulted you, it was as though they were also insulting me."</span>
<span class="v-num v-4 " data-id="bibleJsn">4&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_4" data-id="RM15_4">Remember that all the things written in the scriptures are there to teach us, so that we may become patient in hardship. In this way the scriptures will encourage us to expect that God will do for us everything that he has promised.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-5 " data-id="bibleJsn">5&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_5" data-id="RM15_5">I pray that God give you patience and encouragement so that you all live in peace with each other, doing as the Messiah Jesus did.</span>
<span class="v-num v-6 " data-id="bibleJsn">6&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_6" data-id="RM15_6">If you do this, you all will be praising God together, the Father of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-7 " data-id="bibleJsn">7&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_7" data-id="RM15_7">So I say to all of you believers at Rome, accept each other. If you do that, people will praise God as they see you behave like the Messiah. Accept each other just like the Messiah accepted you!</span>
<span class="v-num v-8 " data-id="bibleJsn">8&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_8" data-id="RM15_8">I want you to remember that the Messiah helped us Jews to know the truth about God. That is, he came to make come true everything that God had promised our ancestors that he would do.</span>
<span class="v-num v-9 " data-id="bibleJsn">9&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_9" data-id="RM15_9">But he also came to help the non-Jews, so they would praise God for his mercy. God's mercy has produced what is written in the scriptures that David said to God: "So I will praise you among the non-Jews; I will sing and praise you."</span>
<span class="v-num v-10 " data-id="bibleJsn">10&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_10" data-id="RM15_10">Moses also wrote, "You non-Jews, rejoice with us who are God's people."</span>
<span class="v-num v-11 " data-id="bibleJsn">11&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_11" data-id="RM15_11">And David wrote in the scriptures, "Praise the Lord, all you non-Jews; may everyone praise him."</span>
<span class="v-num v-12 " data-id="bibleJsn">12&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_12" data-id="RM15_12">And Isaiah wrote in the scriptures, "There will be a descendant of King David who will rule over the non-Jews. They will confidently expect him to fulfill what he has promised."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-13 " data-id="bibleJsn">13&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_13" data-id="RM15_13">I pray that God cause you to be confidently expecting him to do what he has promised. I pray that he will cause you to be completely joyful and peaceful as you trust in him. The Holy Spirit will enable you to more and more confidently expect to receive what God has promised you.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-14 " data-id="bibleJsn">14&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_14" data-id="RM15_14">My fellow believers, I myself am completely sure that you yourselves have acted toward others in a completely good way. You have done that because you have known completely all that God wants you to know and because you are able to teach each other.</span>
<span class="v-num v-15 " data-id="bibleJsn">15&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_15" data-id="RM15_15">However, I have written to you quite openly in this letter about some things in order to remind you about them. I have written this because God has made me an apostle, although I did not deserve this.</span>
<span class="v-num v-16 " data-id="bibleJsn">16&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_16" data-id="RM15_16">He did this in order that I should work for Jesus the Messiah among the non-Jews. God has appointed me to act like a priest as I proclaim his good news in order that he may accept the non-Jews who believe in the Messiah. They will be like an offering that the Holy Spirit has set completely apart for God only.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-17 " data-id="bibleJsn">17&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_17" data-id="RM15_17">It follows that, because of my relationship with the Messiah Jesus, I am happy about my work for God.</span>
<span class="v-num v-18 " data-id="bibleJsn">18&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_18" data-id="RM15_18">I will speak boldly only about the work that the Messiah has accomplished through me that non-Jews might pay attention to the message about the Messiah. These accomplishments came because of words and deeds</span>
<span class="v-num v-19 " data-id="bibleJsn">19&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_19" data-id="RM15_19">by showing signs and other things that convince people. I have done those things God's Spirit has enabled me. In this way I have traveled all the way around from Jerusalem to the province of Illyricum, and I have completed my work of proclaiming the message about the Messiah in those places.</span>
<span class="v-num v-20 " data-id="bibleJsn">20&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_20" data-id="RM15_20">As I proclaim that message, I am always eagerly trying to proclaim it in places where people have not already heard about the Messiah. I do that in order that I might not be simply continuing the work that someone else already started. I do not want to be like a man who builds a house on someone else's foundation.</span>
<span class="v-num v-21 " data-id="bibleJsn">21&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_21" data-id="RM15_21">On the contrary, I teach non-Jews, so that what happens may be like what was written: "The people who have never heard any news about the Messiah, they will see him. Those who have never heard of him will understand about him."</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-22 " data-id="bibleJsn">22&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_22" data-id="RM15_22">Because I have attempted to preach the message about the Messiah in places where they have not heard about him, I have been stopped many times from coming to visit you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-23 " data-id="bibleJsn">23&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_23" data-id="RM15_23">But now there are no more places in these regions where people have not heard about the Messiah. Furthermore, for several years I have wanted to visit you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-24 " data-id="bibleJsn">24&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_24" data-id="RM15_24">So I hope to go to Spain, and I hope that you will help me on my journey. And I would like to pause on my journey for a while in order to enjoy being with you.</span>
<span class="v-num v-25 " data-id="bibleJsn">25&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_25" data-id="RM15_25">But I cannot visit you now, because I am about to go to Jerusalem in order to take money for God's people there.</span>
<span class="v-num v-26 " data-id="bibleJsn">26&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_26" data-id="RM15_26">The believers in the provinces of Macedonia and Achaia decided to contribute money to help the believers in Jerusalem, God's own people, who are poor.</span>
<span class="v-num v-27 " data-id="bibleJsn">27&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_27" data-id="RM15_27">They themselves decided to do this, but truly they owe something to God's people in Jerusalem. The non-Jewish believers benefited spiritually from Jewish believers because they heard the message about the Messiah from them, so the non-Jews should also help the Jewish believers in Jerusalem by giving them material things.</span>
<span class="v-num v-28 " data-id="bibleJsn">28&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_28" data-id="RM15_28">When I finish this task of delivering all this money that the believers in Macedonia and Achaia have given, I will leave Jerusalem and visit you in Rome while I am on my way to Spain.</span>
<span class="v-num v-29 " data-id="bibleJsn">29&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_29" data-id="RM15_29">And I know that when I visit you, the Messiah will abundantly bless us.</span>
</div>
<div class="p">
<span class="v-num v-30 " data-id="bibleJsn">30&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_30" data-id="RM15_30">Because we belong to our Lord Jesus the Messiah and because the Spirit of God causes us to love each other, I urge you all that you help me by fervently praying to God for me.</span>
<span class="v-num v-31 " data-id="bibleJsn">31&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_31" data-id="RM15_31">Pray that God will protect me from the unbelieving Jews while I am in Judea. And pray that the believers in Jerusalem will be glad to receive the money that I am bringing them.</span>
<span class="v-num v-32 " data-id="bibleJsn">32&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_32" data-id="RM15_32">Pray these things in order that God may be pleased for me to come to you, and that I may be able to rest among you—and you rest with me—for a while.</span>
<span class="v-num v-33 " data-id="bibleJsn">33&nbsp;</span><span class="v RM15_33" data-id="RM15_33">I pray that God, who causes us to have peace, will be with all of you and will help you. May it be so!</span>
